RECAP:

GIT: Global Information Tracker 
    We use git to push our codes to remote repos and collaborate with other team mebers or developers/QAs/programmer

GIT is a VCS (Version Control System)
GIT is a distributed version control System

Centralized VCS: We do not prefer this if a server is down or there is not network, we can't push our changes 
Distributed VSC: We have a local copy of the server repo and can keep working even though there is issues with server or network

GitHub / GitLab / Bitbucker / Azure DevOps: All hosting tools/apps where we can store out remote repos 

SSH: Special type of authentication used instead of username and password
It is more secure and uses private-public key pairs
Public is shared with hosting apps while private is in local
Private keys is in your local 

ssh-keygen simpliest ssh set up
