Synchronous vs Asynchronous

-JS is Asynchronous in its nature.
-Synchronous: the code reads in order top to bottom with no issues
-Asynchronous: tasks are executed simultaneously (at the same time or concurrently)

connectToDB(); // 3 seconds
fetchData(); // 2 seconds
useData(); // 0.5 seconds 

3 ways to resolvw Asynchronous nature if the codes - tasks
1. callbacks
2. promises 
3, async-await (syntatical syntax on top of promises)


PROMISES:
-ES6 feature
-Promise stages: pending, fulfilled, rejected
-then() and catch()
