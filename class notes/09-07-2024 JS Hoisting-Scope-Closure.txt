Hoisting: use functions and variables before they're declared 

-Function declarations will be hoisted 
-Arrow functions and function expressions are not hoisted, you cannot use this before their initialization

-var keyword is hoisted 
-let and const are not hoisted
-var-let-const respects the gloal and function Scope
-let and const also respect the block scope while var does not support block scope
