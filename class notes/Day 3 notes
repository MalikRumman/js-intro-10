VARIABLES:
-it is a special container that stores a value
-you can change the initial value ?


var-let-const

Before 2015 (ES6)
-There was only var keyword used for variables
-You can reassign values to var variables

After 2015 (ES6)
-JS introduced 2 new keywords: let and const to be used instead of var keyword
- let can be re-assigned with a new value
-const is used for constants and cannont be re-assigned 

-let can be declared and assigned to value later
-let is going to be undefined if it is declared but not assigned with any value
-consnt cannot be declared without a value and MUST always be initialized with initial value


Data Types:
string: is a text data type which can be stored in varaiables using single or double quotes
number: is number data which can be stored in variables without quotes

concatenation: combining multiple strings together using + operator

nubmer + numer : arithmetic operation
string + string : concatenation
string + number : 

'5' + 3 = '53' 
'5' + 3 + 2 = '532'
'5' + (3 + 2) = '55'
2 + 1 + '0' = '30' 


'Hello' + 'World' = 'HelloWorld'



Variable Naming: How should we name our variables?
- No spaces
- 

Convention: it is not a written rule but followed by all the coders/programmers
