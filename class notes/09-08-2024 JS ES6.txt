let vs const 

similarities
- ES6 features
- they are used to declare variables 
- they can't be hoisted. var is hoisted (declaration moved to the top)
- they both respect function and block scope. var does not respect block scope

differences
- let allows varaibles to be reassigned but const does not.
- const usually used with reference types while let is used with primitives (not all the time)
- let can be declared without initialization but const MUST be initialized.
- const is used for constants that you will never reassign after their initialization/


const varaibleName; // Error
const varaibleName = 5; // Must be initialized

let varaibleName; // udnefined 



***INTERVIEW QUESTION***
Compiler time errors: these are the errors you see before running the program.
Runtime errors: these are the error you see after running the program.


ITERABLE OBJECTS: objects, arrays, maps, sets


***INTERVIEW QUESTION***
spread operator: spreads the array elemts or object properties into their individual elements or properties
rest parameters: is going to collect given arguments in an array 



OOP - Object Oriented Programming 

OOP Languages: C#, C++, Java

JavaScript is proto-type based programming langauge.
ES6 also implemented OOP with classes added.

Object-Oriented programmign means putting real-life objects into programming.
It allows us break down complex objects into smaller pieces in softwares.



const mouse = {
    brand: 'Logi',
    price: 29.99,
    reviews: 4.4,
    colors: [ 'Black', 'Blue', 'White', 'Pink' ]
};

const car = {
    make: 'Mercedes'
    model: 'C63',
    year: 2024,
    price: 50000,
    color: ['Black', 'White']
};


Chase - Banking apps 
const customer = {

};


CONSTRCUTOR: used to create / instansiate an object using new keyword from its template/blueprint/prototype.

const date = new Date()
const arr = new Array();
const obj = new Object();
