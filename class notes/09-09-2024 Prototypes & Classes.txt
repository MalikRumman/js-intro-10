constructor: is a special kind of method used to create objects from rototypes or classes
-An ES6 class can have only ONE constructor
-If we do not create a custom constrcutor, JS will provide us the default constrcutor


class Animal {
    constrcutor() {} // default constructor

    makesNoise() {
        console.log('Makes noise');
    }
}

const a1 = new Aniaml();
a1.makesNoise();



class Date{
    constrcutor() {}

}

const date = new Date();

Class members: properties, constrcutors, functions 

INHERITANCE: it is a common concept used in all the programming languages 
It increases code resuability by child classes from parent classes
properties, function and constrcutors of the parent classes can be inherited
Private properties and functions in parent classes cannot be inherited 
Parent cannot inherit from child 
One child class can have ONLY one parent
One parent class can have multiple child classes 


class A extends B {

}

class C extends A {
    
}

A is the child class 
B is the parent class
