Loops: mechanisms used to run a block of code repeatedly

Iteration: Each time the loops run

1. for loop 
2. for...of loops 
3. while loop
4. do-while loop 
5. for...in loop 


1. FOR LOOP
-aslo known as i loop or traditional loop 
-it uses 3 expressions 
    -initialization: it is the start point for the loop
    -condition: it is the termination point (stop)
    -update: the change for each iteration 

SYNTAX:
for(initialization; condition; update) {
    // block of code to execute 
}

Infinte Loop: it is an error with the loop makes it infinte and never stops.
Be careful with your loop logic and make sure it is not infinite
